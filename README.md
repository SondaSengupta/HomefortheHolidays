Home for the Holidays
==================

<h2>About the App</h2>
<p>The inspiration of this website came from a very practical problem. One of the few traditions in my family during winter is to go out and see the Christmas lights. However, if you’ve done it with your own family, it can be a pretty hit or miss endeavor. You might go into a whole neighborhood drawn by the beautiful lights of one home only to find the rest of the suburb doesn’t share the same festive spirit.</p>

<p>Thus, my Nashville Software School Mid-Capstone project was a site that people could share festive homes in their neighborhood. Without logging in, you can view homes by geolocation or entering a street address. As a logged in user, you can enter and edit these home markers.</p>

<p>As of this moment, the markers have been prepopulated with data from the annual Nashville Lights Competition winners.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to view homes on map by geolocation or entering a street address without needing to log in.</li>
  <li>You can preview a home’s picture, street address, and notes by clicking on its marker which brings up its infobox.</li>
  <li>If you are logged in, you can add comments into the Fireside Chat section.</li>
  <li>The member’s map has the ability to edit information directly from a marker’s infobox. Members can also view all homes in the database as a table.</li>
  <li>Log In/ Log out/ Forget Password is fully functional through Firebase.</li>
</ul>
